Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?: 

The first one, i.e., with 10 simulations 

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?:

All above 1000 are good enough
