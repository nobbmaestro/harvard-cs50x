# CS50x - Introduction to Computer Science

## Course Description

[This is CS50x](https://www.edx.org/learn/computer-science/harvard-university-cs50-s-introduction-to-computer-science),
Harvard University's introduction to the intellectual enterprises of computer science and the art of
programming for majors and non-majors alike, with or without prior programming experience. An entry-level course taught
by David J. Malan, CS50x teaches students how to think algorithmically and solve problems efficiently. Topics include
abstraction, algorithms, data structures, encapsulation, resource management, security, software engineering, and web
development. Languages include C, Python, SQL, and JavaScript plus CSS and HTML. Problem sets inspired by real-world
domains of biology, cryptography, finance, forensics, and gaming. The on-campus version of CS50x , CS50, is Harvard's
largest course.
